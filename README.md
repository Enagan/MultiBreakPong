# MultiBreakPong - An Unreal Engine 4 Multiplayer Pong / Breakout game

MultiBreakPong is a real time multiplayer pong like game. But with Breakout blocks randomly appearing in the middle of the play field, to shake things up!
This project was made as a way of learning how to work with unreal, and more specifically, how to work with Unreal's replication for multiplayer.
As my first Unreal project ever, I'm quite sure there's a lot that I could improve, had I more experience.
Each source file is commented, to explain what it's doing and why it's doing it.

## How to Run it:

- Open the Unreal project in the 'Breakinout' level
- Click on the down arrow next to the play button and in the multiplayer option section, set Number of Players to 2
- Click play
- The in editor player, controls the orange stick, client controls blue.
- Have fun!
